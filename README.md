# Vision_ELCo project description

This project investigates the role of visual information in enhancing emoji composition understanding. We propose a visually-informed fine-tuning pipeline that equips language models with five key visual aspects beyond emoji names: visual scene, spatial composition, posture/expression, color palette, and an overall description. Our fine-tuned models demonstrate superior performance across all five emoji entailment types. To guide future improvements, we analyze cases of incorrect predictions to identify model weaknesses. Overall, our findings offer valuable insights into how visually grounded representations can improve language models' understanding of emojis.
